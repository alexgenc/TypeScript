- Public Variables: Accessible from anywhere.

- Private Variables: Accessible only inside the class where variables are defined.

- Protected Variables: Similar to private variables but protected variables are also accessible from other classes that inherit from the class where those variables are defined.

- Abstract Class: A class that can't be instantiated but has to be extended.

- Singleton Class: A singleton class is configured such that you don't create it with "new" but by calling a method which then ensures that only one instance of the class exists at any given time.
